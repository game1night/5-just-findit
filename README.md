5 - the first artificial test from image to dataset via tensorflow keras

## 5-just-findout

## Intro

This is a small tool-box for images classification from 0 to 1.

Since there're lots of tools, why should someone waste time here? Just for record. And, know 1 is better than know nothing. Know how to get 1 is also fun for the someone. It's the first time to do something really related to AI. Cool and more convenient. Thanks. 

You'll get the core hard part of this kind of tasks. Good luck. Since this project is built under the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) of GPL 3.0 so you can share it under it. If any issue, let me know. Thanks.

### Start

There're three steps.

First, find the image and split it into the you-like and more-possible size.

Second, find the different classes and give tags artifically (enjoy:)

Third, find the almost-right model and find more images to classify via AI.


### Build

1. 切出合适的图片大小、部位。
2. 人工筛选、标注。
3. 模型的建立、优化。
